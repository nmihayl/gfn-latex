# Debian 12 Minecraft Forge Server Tutorial

This repository hosts the LaTeX source code to a tutorial document for installing a Minecraft Forge server on a Debian 12 virtual machine.

This document is intended for use within my current system administration class in the GFN GmbH but is of **no** official association with the company and all the instructions should be down as a private/personal project.

This is currently the initial draft written in English but the finalized document will be published both in English and German.
